  <div class="content">
	
<p>Hello!welcome to my blog of travel and online video life.<p>
  I am a travel vlogger, videographer, blogger and comedy youtuber who travels the world and shares my experiences and travel
  expertise via social media and through my videos.

My travel credentials include over 48+ countries visited, all recorded on video over the last 5 years and shared to over 280,000+ subscribers on my youtube channel.

I have also spoke on expert business panels at the Canadian Media Producers Association, Playlist Live, VidCon and Buffer Festival . Plus was a keynote speaker at the 2016 Women in Travel Summit.
In December 2014 I was invited as one of the Top 130 of the most inï¬‚uential travel bloggers and digital media outlets to the White House to attend the White House Travel Blogger Summit on Study Abroad and Global Citizenship.

My passion for travel and love for comedy is contagious and I love sharing the destinations I visit in fun and funny videos and blog posts that teach and inspire others to follow their travel dreams!
